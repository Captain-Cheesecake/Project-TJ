# TJBot-Visual
A short guide on how to turn your Raspberry Pi from NOOB to a TJBot with IBM Watson services

(please note that this only the software side of things, for body plans go here http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-TJ-Bot-Out-of-Cardboard/ and for folding go here http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-TJ-Bot-Out-of-Cardboard/step3/Folding-TJBot-Part-1/ and here http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-TJ-Bot-Out-of-Cardboard/step4/Folding-TJBot-Part-2/ )

Standard rules apply with this project so you are going to need some basic hardware and some extras

You will need:
- Micro USB
- USB (or 3.5mm jack) Speakers - I find these often work better than bluetooth, even on Pi 3
- USB Microphone
- Pi Cam
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- WIFI dongle / Ethernet cable

now you are ready for step 1,

Go to the Raspberry Pi website and download a NOOBS of your choosing
